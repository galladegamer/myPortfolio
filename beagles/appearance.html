				<h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="image">

				</p>
				<p>The general appearance of the Beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average. </p>
				<br>
				<p>They have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle and a <sec class="black2">black</sec> (or occasionally <sec class="liver">liver</sec>) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong, the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth, and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, <sec class="brown">hazel</sec> or <sec class="black">brown</sec>, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the "stern") tipped with <sec class="white2">white</sec>. The <sec class="white2">white</sec> tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The Beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>-colored Beagle—<sec class="tri1">white</sec> with large <sec class="tri2">black</sec> areas and <sec class="tri3">light brown</sec> shading—is the most common. <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>-colored Beagles occur in a number of shades, from the "Classic <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> with a jet <sec class="black2">black</sec> saddle (also known as "<sec class="black2">Black</sec>back"), to the "Dark <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> (where faint <sec class="brown">brown</sec> markings are intermingled with more prominent <sec class="black2">black</sec> markings), to the "Faded <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> (where faint <sec class="black2">black</sec> markings are intermingled with more prominent <sec class="brown">brown</sec> markings). Some <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>colored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as pied. These dogs have mostly <sec class="white2">white</sec> coats with patches of <sec class="black2">black</sec> and <sec class="brown">brown</sec> hair. <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>color Beagles are usually born <sec class="black2">black</sec> and <sec class="white2">white</sec>. The <sec class="white2">white</sec> areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the <sec class="black2">black</sec> areas may fade to <sec class="brown">brown</sec> as the puppy matures. (The <sec class="brown">brown</sec> may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their <sec class="black2">black</sec> markings entirely.</p>
				<br>
				<p><sec class="two1">Two</sec>-<sec class="two2">color</sec> varieties always have a <sec class="white2">white</sec> base color with areas of the second color. <sec class="tan2">Tan</sec> and <sec class="white2">white</sec> is the most common <sec class="two1">two</sec>-<sec class="two2">color</sec> variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including <sec class="lemon">lemon</sec>, a very <sec class="tan2">light tan</sec>; <sec class="red">red</sec>, a <sec class="red2">reddish</sec>, almost <sec class="red3">orange</sec>, <sec class="brown">brown</sec>; and <sec class="liver">liver</sec>, a darker <sec class="brown">brown</sec>, and <sec class="black2">black</sec>. <sec class="liver">Liver</sec> is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with <sec class="lemon">yellow</sec> eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either <sec class="white2">white</sec> or <sec class="black2">black</sec> with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the <sec class="blue2">blue</sec>-mottled or <sec class="blue2">blue</sec>tick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight <sec class="blue2">blue</sec> color, similar to the coloring of the <sec class="blue2">Blue</sec>tick Coonhound. Some <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>color Beagles also have ticking of <sec id="v1">v</sec><sec id="v2">a</sec><sec id="v3">r</sec><sec id="v4">i</sec><sec id="v5">o</sec><sec id="v6">u</sec><sec id="v7">s</sec> <sec id="v8">c</sec><sec id="v9">o</sec><sec id="v10">l</sec><sec id="v11">o</sec><sec id="v12">r</sec><sec id="v13">s</sec> in their <sec class="white2">white</sec> areas.</p>
