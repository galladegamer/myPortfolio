				<p>The Beagle is a breed of small hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The Beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the Beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The Beagle is intelligent but single- minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip Peanuts has been promoted as "the world's most famous beagle". <sec class="blue">Blue</sec> and <sec class="magenta">Magenta</sec> from <sec class="italics">"Blue's Clues"</sec> and the new reboot <sec class="italics">"Blue's Clues &amp; You!"</sec> are also beagles. While it isn't specifically said that <sec class="blue">Blue</sec> and <sec class="magenta">Magenta</sec> are beagles, The beagle is the breed of dog that <sec class="blue">Blue</sec> and <sec class="magenta">Magenta</sec> most closely resemble. Despite this, <a href="appearance.html">Beagles can not be any shade of <sec class="blue">blue</sec> or <sec class="magenta">magenta.</sec></a></p>
